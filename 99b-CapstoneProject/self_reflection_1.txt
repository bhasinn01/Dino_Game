NOTE: If you are working by yourself (no teammates), then use this file
(self_reflection_1.txt).  If you are working with teammates, then the order
of the names in your team repository determines who uses which of the three
self_reflection_X.txt files, as per this example:
   For team     csse120-202110-andersm3-morrisnc-sheerimm
     -- anderssm3 must use   self_reflection_1.txt
     -- morrisnc  must use   self_reflection_2.txt
     -- sheerimm  must use   self_reflection_3.txt
Another example:
   For team     csse120-202101-kintnecm-rams-harristj
     -- kintnecm  must use   self_reflection_1.txt
     -- rams      must use   self_reflection_2.txt
     -- harristj  must use   self_reflection_3.txt

Then answer the following questions.
Answers can be BRIEF, but we expect them to be THOUGHTFUL answers.

1.  Explain, in a sentence or two, something that SURPRISED you
    after you began working on your project.

2.  Identify something that you would have done DIFFERENTLY in your project,
    with hindsight.  Then explain, in a short paragraph, how you did that
    something (in your actual project), how you would have done it differently,
    why you would do it differently, and how you would encourage yourself
    to do it (or its equivalent) differently in future projects.

3.  Identify something that you are particularly PROUD of your work in your
    project.  Explain, in a short paragraph, what it is, why you are proud
    of it, and how you will encourage yourself to do it (or its equivalent)
    similarly in future projects.

    In general, I am proud of how I worked through coding the game. I broke it down
    into little pieces and every time I encountered a problem I made little changes
    to figure out how I could fix it. I drew stuff out and went in with a list of what
    was going to be in each class. After breaking it down and figuring stuff out
